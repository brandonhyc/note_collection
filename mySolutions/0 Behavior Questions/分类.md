# Failure：（Customer Obsession， Earn Trust ）
1. Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?
I was to developing a UI feature to group and display information. There was a easy widget I could reuse but I also collaborated with UX team and they suggested a more complex design with better user experience. You know, I tried to follow their design and developed the feature. But I ended up missing the deadline because it takes more time then I thought because it was highly-customized component. I really had a lesson learn there. If I meet a challenging task, I would need to discuss with my team on the cost of team. I should save time for the MVP to meet the requirement to avoid missing the deadline. But I will implement the complex version to provide better user experience.

2. We all deal with difficult customers from time to time. Tell me about a challenging client-facing situation and how you handled it.
In a project, I had a mini workgroup of polit users. My BA and they work together and share a document which records all some function requirement for the system and also the deadline for each period. The drama was in the planning meeting my manager was unhappy because some users complain that function I finished was not fully built. But then BA explained for me that the client updated the document and added more functions that we did not realize in the first place. After that my team and I learned that we will need to check and updated our progress to the team more frequently. If we can't meet the deadline, we would communicate with the client in the half way to the deadline. Also, most importantly, talk to the client and explain we would have to extend the deadline if the requirement is updated.

3. What’s the most innovative new idea that you have implemented?
When I join this new team, we use the newest tech stack in the organization and a developer left the team. This module was built on Angular. So I became sort of the only one in the whole organization using Angular to develop the system. But our web app requires building Angular and JSP which even increase the difficulties. So I had to build the wheal by myself rather than only using features out of box, also I need to consider how to make the component easier to maintain and more reuseable for other teammates, sometimes refactor for new requirements. So now my teammate can easily reuse some of my components. And the polit user 9 out of 10 users give great feedback. 

4. Tell me about a time when you had to push back to HQ or challenged a decision
5. Describe a situation when you negotiated with others in your organization to reach an agreement.
